On March 26th, ['El Pais'](https://elpais.com/espana/madrid/2021-03-26/madrid-se-cae-de-la-bici-aumentan-un-270-los-accidentes-en-10-anos.html) newspaper published a news regarding the increment of the accidents during the last ten years. The news mentioned that neither experts nor associations have been able to find a reason in order to understand these events.     Therefore, these questions derive in the interest to understand the data of the accidents in order to find relevant results.

For this post, the data of Traffic accidents involving bicycles from Madrid's community has been used. The data can be found in this [link](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=20f4a87ebb65b510VgnVCM1000001d4a900aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default) and its [data description](https://datos.madrid.es/FWProjects/egob/Catalogo/Seguridad/Ficheros/Estructura_DS_Accidentes_Bicicletas_2010_2018.pdf) is also included. For this analysis, the data from 2019 to the present has been used. In order to perform this analysis, Python language has been used as well as three libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn. The entire code can be found [here](https://github.com/JoseDiego101/Blog). Also, all this report has been performed in Visual Studio Code in a local environment. 

This post contains a data exploration and data visualization of several variables in order to compare the data between years, gender, type of accident, among others.

## Data Analysis

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The exploratory data analysis has had the following steps: 


1. Upload the useful packages:
<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HTpJUg-nIn5AvRHWVHYewjadEQjT2LypNvLCj2GyR4g3o9Kt2JS9lHEwEJ4nKyTbPgxslhtIYooubu_3kDK7h6xQu8rYMRbzfMR_2pE4FWS-1wNcb8-KKoiENg0gsCswbwSSw25pTg=w2400"/>

2. Read the CSV files:
<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PjgLzjZ12ls5EemoApsYN4Rt-T8f6WAgh1NqrxVqZP7i8mhJ6JGyiepDg4pnOnIZaFEmjM2c9d75zSQh7Dt__IM1rAPHccJh21M-vRuKiHvQhZ6143xyltd9fG5teZT1yqtAbNxGcQ=w2400"/>

3. See the keys and the shape of the three datasets:
<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8CXiLzqPffc9oC4ZZjnC-D_IrnAYh3IXNcFIvO2HmdNleXgqHB-ayx-r4N_fatTSKlgqLtoIqiSOD20BsB1vzhXH-tXXKKnA62fzgD3Pv8gXiL08wlbfGuYQQmB6HfMYUxTLZ9zMcw=w2400"/>

4. Rename the column 'RANGO EDAD' of the dataset from 2019 because the column name is different from the others.
<p align="center">

<p>&nbsp;</p>

5. Join the three datasets in a single one:
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YhWqGWM5N1GZC28-14Q_MyU2GBFKaZQQ9KYnNpE0zbHD4z--PIm7-DJlG_Za_RDjXXq5c0rePZM3QCL7DGhiG7VTGsqrqGx2tRhuyTjNabWyuBE7vwQgV-7oVNMSfY3p1r3LpP_H_g=w2400"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

6. Eliminate empty values:
<p align="center">

<p>&nbsp;</p>

7. Rename the colum names:
<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4eAa77asfzYi0ONCL1l4kxRi4e5teNqyETxLj6D5QaNqFmxks-bfzbYuo_uSbmgItpfA4cAUtFaakbr26BAZgHoKEzcnzhLRBby_MYN9DssU1uno7OINiBi1olIdpTGRMK6YutLKuw=w2400"/><p>&nbsp;</p>

8. Remove columns that have not been used for analysis:
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8az_2hNnZN2ALcguZ6kWZ4jynJGm6eayjiIEAfvrvLK560OObDlWF2AWzkOArthcpD5P4wPX95ovkWtAnCTJvin9fiKoN0v7z8snbKnAUKYkf2MaeOWXXq1AmfAHiXd9gYb8eHucuQ=w2400"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

9. Change the type of the variable 'fecha' from object to datetime in order to extract month and year:
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I9py78AcdD5DVF2YM6tlNVQAxSW5smdo0vVHipcjglMB7ZSMRO9DScympYK5UTvMszN8iRqvXfXqH1Y8A1T4gFNOm81pkdK0fQjBEAuFGMLR2x0yp4CcFReMKcuHu2Sp1r3CVbTdtw=w2400"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

10. Create new columns with month and year for each entry:
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3q7T7VeP3pOo1KfD2Ec2kS4YghdWUySc6CPI6X-iEUHqkg0ASwtsdo5soCivcpPwRx1ENuqPjDIV5wqN8QeYTmxTxIXPRMYxi7FqNMeIwjz8JMh2DwhSmdu-pW4sWNr1ijhviSXhgQ=w2400"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
11. Sort dataset by month and year: 
<p align="center">
<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7U7ZZwPKDSgnYx-cSLFHy_k2R3gZFywXJH1gWmyUVDAcbjRgAmW2FTrxzNmT5nKV-tM2bjmDOiMAr-TCRuiy4bcatgagnzyFe8GshVai487iVjMkBQ57ZAYS-UnDVawiyoV_JR7hIA=w2400"/></p>

Once all the steps have been carried out, the general information and a sample of the final dataset are shown below:
<p align="center">

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Data Visualization

<p>&nbsp;</p>

After of data exploration, the visualizations has been achieved. First, the frequency of accidents by district has been performed. The accidents most frequent occur in the center of the town, followed by Arganzuela, Moncloa - Aravaca, Salamanda, and Retiro. The district with less accidents has been Vicalvaro.

<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nL42Cu_a28QhT8IVbbRKrVYVahiogdUX7i3NWLGahZ-BvPoMYsPxunHi1cxjHu7FPROQjb34SK-qeEC_vTj_K26fXCxjGVH7cjvXZ0WP_otS7THecGopEpisv8-uzmIX_Sj0Vxf8YA=w2400" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The next plot has been the gender. The plot of below says us that Males have more accidents than Females for al the years that we have analyzed. The difference between genders is very marked. Until so far this year, the males have had more accidents than females and this fulfills the same pattern than the previous years.

<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/h5nks1wtyVZsIZ1pJadi0urtcoFfmnbWiERtQsg4JngGdhgIC5xggJKXrd08GE_Sem9dCSRqohxOh4llp_9NjnRG3woBsjutiMPNu0CNg2lENTOpBtDL4ZcvOylFtE1tNgkQwiBKrg=w2400"/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Following this analysis, another interesting feature to visualize is the frequency of accidents by month and year. The plot say us that the most frequent month has been June. The month with the lowest frequency has been January. On 2021, March and April have had more accidents if we compare with the previous years. At the beginning, we can think that on 2020 there is less accidents that 2019 due to the lockdowns applied on the region. Despite this, 2020 has had more accidents than 2019 as seen in the picture below: 

<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H4V2K-MQ3_eqmSWHY_fpZV_i5UNO-emXM5-gZ8K-9kO-P70z4Z1CP1Rav_iQk5jYk2eubMSiIUx7tmevxjnub1wH7QRa6b9s3Adox9nCi41pOFmGirz1KpTGS4GH7mQjces7WaS0qA=w2400"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

For the total of the data that has been used in this report, the most frequent type of accident has been bike falls. The least frequent are bicycle overturns.

<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_VnMKrFcgVkd4F55Vc3hlACEgjxwYVJYnc-p17hLihYMvKGWmZqUWDE6CN5f_R-OLeeRVS8r508aZlhkXcm5lT2lAoXHK2_u9WoWNay1yZLCUDrfV6fQ3NsgXpiCAiCLNu5b9HBNOA=w2400"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Taking into consideration the age, the most frequent age range has been between 25 and 39 years old. In addition, we can see from the plot that the smallest kids are also included in bicycle acidents.

<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QwLpAdMD84ZhpDAanO_WBLIN3D-YiYVGuOubm9jqdFF2F5-LyvacOnJQVbL-Vz9iA3LCpXBZMge9WY0261XGdBB6T9uz7sNf12kuKug1pfMStrDL1kuXLyQvybmhdXGb6pYHyBgSnA=w2400"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Finally, the last plot in this report has been harmfulness, where the most frequent has been the value of seven where it means 'Healthcare only at the scene of the accident - LEVE'. A major description of the harmfulness is shown below of the image.

<img src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qYic-vZiJ2YgTurwvhSNGSgxFovVbvL7owN9gYBxy0koDX5yXHbd_Zl8oZDVdLJHgKHuU_gP8WPBKLf4JAJbBjU0iW0L9YXwF52sB8TFeQiNuFBwuB_41jcpj2qYzPgZC3knBgeJLQ=w2400"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Harmfulness description:

1.  Emergency care without subsequent admission - SLIGHT
2. Income less than or equal to 24 hours - SLIGHT
3. Income greater than 24 hours - SERIOUS
4. Deceased 24 hours - DECEASED
5. Outpatient health care afterwards - SLIGHT
6. Immediate health care in a health center or mutual - SLIGHT
7. Medical assistance only at the scene of the accident - SLIGHT
8. No healthcare (On the plot this level correspond to 14)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Conclusions

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The exploration and visualization of the data regarding bicycle accidents has been performed. From the results, we can conclude that the accidentes has been most frequent on the center of Madrid's Community where the males are more implicated tha females. Also, the month with most incidences has been June.
The bike falls has been the most common type where the most frequent age range has been between 25 to 29 years old.
The most common harmfulness has been  'Emergency care without subsequent admission - SLIGHT'. Finally, this report has allowed to see the increment of accidents and concluded that despite of virus and lockwdowns, 2020 had more accidents than 2019.
